# AI-Powered Indian Cattle Breed Identification and Monitoring System

This project uses **Raspberry Pi, AI, and sensors** to identify Indian cattle breeds and monitor environmental conditions in real time. A pre-trained deep learning model classifies images of cattle into **50 officially recognized Indian breeds**, while sensors provide temperature and humidity readings.
